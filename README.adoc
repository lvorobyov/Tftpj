= File transfer server on Java

The simple file transfer server, that recognises file formats

== Installation

clone this repository and compile. Then run `java -jar tftpj.jar`

Tftpj listens the 8970 tcp and uses the same udp port. So add them to the firewall exceptions.

On other side call this: `nc -vN localhost 8970 < file.mp3`.

In the directory with server appears a file `downloaded_<timestamp>.mp3`. Done.
